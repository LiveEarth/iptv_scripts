### The challenge
Lets imagine that we have an iptv device similar like [this one](https://www.infomir.eu/eng/products/archive/mag-257/ "Infomir MAG 257") and it is located in the grandparents in the village. In the best case, we will paid for iptv subscription and this article will not exist. But things are sometimes not so ideal and a solution to the problem must be sought.
In this article I will share one of probably many answers of question - how we can use static iptv playlist with dynamicly changed channel source into it.

### The BIG picture in my head :)
